    <h1>The History of the Chicken</h1>
    <p>From Apex Predator to Professional Egg-Layer.</p>

    <div class="era">
        <h2>1. The "Don't Eat Me" Era (68 Million Years Ago)</h2>
        <p>Before they were nuggets, chickens were basically <strong>T-Rexes</strong> . Science shows they are the closest living relative to the king of dinosaurs . Imagine a T-Rex, but instead of roaring, it just wants a handful of corn.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2>2. The Jungle Fever (8,000 Years Ago)</h2>
        <p>Chickens started as <strong>Red Junglefowl</strong> in Southeast Asia . Humans originally kept them for "cockfighting" rather than eating—it took us a few thousand years to realize they were delicious .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2>3. The Roman Resort (800 BC)</h2>
        <p>The Romans went wild for chickens. They invented the <strong>omelet</strong> and even tried to fatten birds with bread soaked in wine . One Roman law in 161 BC actually tried to limit people to eating only one chicken per meal to stop "moral decay" .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="era">
        <h2>4. Modern Day Superstars</h2>
        <p>Today, chickens outnumber humans 3-to-1 . They can recognize 100 different faces and even have their own "language" with over 30 different sounds .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="fun-fact">
        <strong>Mind-Blowing Fact:</strong> The longest recorded flight of a chicken is only 13 seconds . They aren't lazy; they're just "ground-based enthusiasts."
