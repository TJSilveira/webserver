    <h1>404 Not Found</h1>
    <h2>An Egg-stremely Rare Error!</h2>
    <p>
        The page you are looking for has crossed the road and never came back . 
        It might have flown the coop, or perhaps it never existed in the first place—much like the answer to "which came first?"

    <div class="joke">
        <strong>Why did the 404 error cross the road?</strong><br>
        Because it heard there was a missing link on the other side!
